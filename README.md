Health Care Spending Per Capita

The data I am visualizing is the per capita health care spending in 2016 between different countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and health care spending in the USA from 1980 to 2016. The data comes from the OECD[0] and the National Health Expenditure Accounts[1]. I'm using a bar chart to represent the data.
